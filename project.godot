config/name="BreakOut"
config/description="\"Experience an exciting vertical Breakout game designed for desktop. In this game, the difficulty increases with every level as the ball speed ramps up by 10% with each progression. The block patterns dynamically change as you advance, with three distinct formations to keep things fresh. Use your mouse to move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball, and press 'P' or 'ESC' to pause the game whenever needed.

If the ball goes out of the play area, you can restart from the level you reached, ensuring a smooth flow of gameplay. There are six different brick colors to add visual variety. Some bricks are larger and require two hits to break; after the first hit, they shrink and turn into small bricks. Enjoy immersive sound effects and music that enhance the game experience as you play.\""
